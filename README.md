# libfluid
Welcome to the **libfluid** bundle repository.

This is the right place to get started: see the 
[quick start guide](http://opennetworkingfoundation.github.io/libfluid/md_doc_QuickStart.html)
for instructions on cloning and building. For an overview of the project, see 
our [home page](http://opennetworkingfoundation.github.io/libfluid/).

## About this repository
This is the repository for the  **libfluid**, which is formed by two separate 
and independent libraries:
* [**libfluid_base**](https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/libfluid_base): a library that provides the connection layer for the 
OpenFlow protocol
* [**libfluid_msg**](https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/libfluid_msg): a library that provides the messaging layer for the 
OpenFlow protocol

In this repository you'll find scripts for cloning and building both libraries,
documentation and examples. Run the `bootstrap.sh` script to initialize 
everything.

Issues regarding documentation and examples should be 
[reported](https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/libfluid/issues) in this 
repository. Issues with **libfluid_msg** and **libfluid_base** should be 
reported in their own repositories.
